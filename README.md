# w3m_fetch
CLI tools and zsh filename completion for quickly fetching remote files via
HTTP/S from indexes which are auto-generated by various web servers.

Usage:

- Install `wget`+`w3m`. Optionally also `fzf` and `fzf-tab`.
- Add `w3m_fetch`+`w3m_dump` to `$PATH`.
- Add `completion/_w3m_fetch` to `$fpath`.
- Restart zsh (`exec zsh`).
- `w3m_fetch https://example.com/files/<TAB><TAB>` and you should get a fully
  qualified list of URLs to choose from. Selected urls are passed onto wget for
  fetching.
- Partial matches also work, e.g.: `w3m_fetch
  https://example.com/files/file-suffix<TAB><TAB>` will restrict results to the
  provided suffix (via zsh's completion mechanisms).
